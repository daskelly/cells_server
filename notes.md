Modify httpd.conf with your document root directory to point Apache to your siteâ€™s files - I am 
using default dir /var/www/html.

Restart apache:
```
sudo systemctl enable httpd.service
sudo systemctl restart httpd.service
```

Install and run a demo of CellBrowser
```
sudo yum -y install python-pip
sudo pip install cellbrowser
cd; curl -s https://cells.ucsc.edu/downloads/samples/mini.tgz | tar xvz
cd mini
cbBuild -o ~/public_html/cells/ -p 8888
```

Go to IP_address:8888.

# Developing a demo served by Apache

```
sudo yum install mosh
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
sudo pip install numpy
```

Added `CBOUT` to `~/.bashrc`.

For some reason cbBuild with `-o $CBOUT` trying to serve with Apache doesn't seem to be working ...
